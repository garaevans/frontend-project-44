"Brain Games" is a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile brain training apps. Each game asks questions that require correct answers. After three correct answers, the game is considered passed. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to start it again. The games are:

- **brain-calc** — Calculator. Arithmetic expressions that need to be calculated.
- **brain-progression** — Progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
- **brain-even** — Determining even numbers.
- **brain-gcd** — Determining the greatest common divisor.
- **brain-prime** — Determining a prime number.
